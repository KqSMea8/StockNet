> Stock movement prediction is a challenging problem: the market is highly *stochastic*, and we make *temporally-dependent* predictions from *chaotic* data. We treat these three complexities and present a novel deep generative model jointly exploiting text and price signals for this task. Unlike the case with discriminative or topic modeling, our model introduces recurrent, continuous latent variables for a better treatment of stochasticity, and uses neural variational inference to address the intractable posterior inference. We also provide a hybrid objective with  temporal auxiliary to flexibly capture predictive dependencies. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed model on a new stock movement prediction dataset which we collected.

## Dataset Overview
Two-year price movements from 01/01/2014 to 01/01/2016 of 88 stocks are selected to target, coming from all the 8 stocks in the Conglomerates sector and the top 10 stocks in capital size in each of the other 8 sectors. The full list of 88 stocks and their companies selected from 9 sectors is available in **StockTable**, a facsimile of the paper appendix **appendix\_table\_of\_target\_stocks.pdf**.

## Data Component
This dataset comprises two main components,

* **./tweet**: tweet data from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)
* **./price**: price data from [Yahoo Finance](http://nance.yahoo.com/) 

Each component contains their raw data and preprocessed data organized by stocks,  

* **./tweet/raw**
* **./tweet/preprocessed**

and  

* **./price/raw**  
* **./price/preprocessed**
